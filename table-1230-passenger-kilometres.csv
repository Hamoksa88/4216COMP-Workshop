Notes:,,,,
"1.   This dataset does not include Eurostar, Underground or light rail services.",,,,
"2.   This dataset now includes the three non-franchised operators: Grand Central, Heathrow Express and Hull Trains.",,,,
3.   Data for 1938 to 1985-86 sourced from the Department for Transport. No data available for 1939 to 1945.,,,,
"4.   Data for 1986-87 to 2002-03 sourced from CAPRI (Computer Analysis of Passenger Revenue Information), which was the rail industry’s former central ticketing system, and train operating companies (1999-00 to 2002-03). Passenger kilometres travelled using some operator-specific tickets and Passenger Transport Executive multi-modal tickets are not included in the estimates for 1986-87 to 1998-99.",,,,
5.   Data for 2003-04 onwards sourced from the LENNON (Latest Earnings Networked Nationally Over Night) ticketing and revenue database and train operating companies.,,,,
"6.   The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led to an unprecedented number of season ticket refund claims. This required the use of an alternative methodology to estimate season and other ticket usage in 2020-21. As a result, there is more uncertainty around the 2020-21 season and other estimates than in previous quarters. This is the reason for the series break indicated before the 2020-21 estimates.",,,,
r.   The number of passenger kilometres travelled using season and other tickets have been revised down by around 120 million kilometres a year (prior to the inclusion of non-franchised passenger kilometres in this dataset) due to the overstating of Merseyrail passenger kilometres included as part of the non-LENNON component of the data.,,,,
